    "article": "Earth\u2019s surface is not made up of a single sheet of rock that forms a crust but rather a number of \u201ctectonic plates\u201d that fit closely, like the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle. Some plates carry islands or continents, others form the seafloor. All are slowly moving because the plates float on a denser semi-liquid mantle, the layer between the crust and Earth\u2019s core. The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates collide and one plunges beneath the other), or transform faults (where two plates neither converge nor diverge but merely move past one another). It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth\u2019s volcanism and earthquake activity occur.\nGenerally speaking, the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful. However, there are exceptions. A glance at a map of the Pacific Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes----many no longer active, some overgrown with coral----that originated from activity at points in the interior of the Pacific Plate that forms the Pacific seafloor.\n\nHow can volcanic activity occur so far from a plate boundary? The Hawaiian islands provide a very instructive answer. [\u25a0]Like many other island groups, they form a chain. \n  [\u25a0]The Hawaiian Islands Chain extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. [\u25a0]In the 1840s American geologist James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands seem to share a similar geologic\n evolution but are progressively more eroded, and therefore probable older, toward the northwest. [\u25a0]Then in 1963, in the early days of the development of the theory of plate tectonics. \n Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface plate moving over a fixed volcanic source in the interior.\n Wilson suggested that the long chain of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is simply the surface expression of a long-lived volcanic source located beneath the tectonic plate in the mantle.\nToday\u2019s most northwest island would have been the first to form. They as the plate moved slowly northwest, new volcanic islands would have forms as the plate moved over the volcanic source. \n The most recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the chain and is now over the volcanic source.\n\nAlthough this idea was not immediately accepted, the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano, just as Daly had suggested. Wilson\u2019s analysis of these data is now a central part of plate tectonics. Most volcanoes that occur in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by mantle plumes, columns of molten rock that rise from deep within the mantle. A volcano remains an active \u201chot spot\u201d as long as it is over the plume. The plumes apparently originate at great depths, perhaps as deep as the boundary between the core and the mantle, and many have been active for a very long time. The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot trail have ages close to 80 million years. Other islands, including Tahiti and Easter Islands in the pacific, Reunion and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most of the large islands in the world\u2019s oceans, owe their existence to mantle plumes.\nThe oceanic volcanic islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for geologist because they record the past locations of the plate over a fixed source. They therefore permit the reconstruction of the process of seafloor spreading, and consequently of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, given the current position of the Pacific Plate, Hawaii is above the Pacific Ocean hot spot. So the position of The Pacific Plate 50 million years ago can be determined by moving it such that a 50-million-year-old volcano in the hot-spot trail sits at the location of Hawaii today. However because the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times scale, reconstruction the world\u2019s geography by backtracking along the hot-spot trail works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time.\n ",
